## Title: Unlocking the Secrets of Bank Marketing Engagement

In the bustling world of banking, understanding customer engagement is paramount. Our latest deep dive into the marketing data has revealed compelling insights that can transform our strategies and drive more meaningful connections with our customers.

---

### The Grand Overview: 11 Million Minutes of Conversations

Our bank has accumulated a staggering 11 million minutes in total contact duration. This immense figure is a testament to the extensive interactions we have with our diverse customer base. However, it's not just about the volume; it's about understanding the story these numbers tell.

---

### Role Duration Insights: A Closer Look at Who’s Engaged

Let's delve into the different roles our customers play and how engaged they are:

1. **Students** - Leading the pack with an average contact duration of around 280 minutes, students are not just the future but a highly engaged present.
2. **Retired Individuals** - With slightly lower engagement than students, this group shows significant interest in our offerings.
3. **Blue-Collar Workers** - They also exhibit high engagement, reflecting the trust and reliance they place on our services.
4. **Freelancers and Unemployed** - At the lower end of the spectrum, with average durations around 240 minutes, indicating potential areas for increased focus and tailored outreach.

**Decision**: **Enhance Student and Retiree Programs** - Given their high engagement, we should create more targeted programs for students and retirees. For freelancers and the unemployed, a more personalized approach might help boost their interaction levels.

---

### The Daily Dance: Tracking Engagement Over Time

Our day-by-day analysis for May reveals a rollercoaster of engagement. Peaks and valleys show that while some days spark interest, others fall flat. For instance, the beginning and end of May saw significant spikes, hinting at possible external factors or successful campaign timings.

**Decision**: **Optimize Contact Timing** - By analyzing these fluctuations further, we can identify the factors driving higher engagement on specific days and replicate these conditions. This could mean tweaking our communication schedules or aligning our outreach with key dates and events.

---

### Occupation Age Profile: Age Matters

Our data shows the average age varies across occupations:

- **Retired Individuals** - With an average age of 62 years, they are our most seasoned customers.
- **Freelancers and Entrepreneurs** - Averaging around 45-46 years, these groups bring a mix of experience and modern business acumen.
- **Students** - At an average age of 25, they represent the youngest demographic, ripe for long-term relationship building.

**Decision**: **Tailored Messaging** - Crafting messages that resonate with each age group’s unique needs and preferences can enhance engagement. For older customers, emphasizing stability and security might be key, while younger audiences might appreciate innovation and tech-savvy solutions.

---

### Marital Status: Understanding Personal Contexts

A significant portion of our contacts are married, followed by singles and divorced individuals. This demographic insight helps us appreciate the personal contexts within which our customers make financial decisions.

**Decision**: **Family-Oriented Campaigns** - For married customers, highlighting family-oriented financial products can be impactful. Singles might value flexible and independent financial planning tools, while divorced individuals might appreciate support in financial restructuring.

---

### Educational Impact: Correlating Duration with Education

The scatter plot reveals fascinating correlations between education levels and contact duration. Certain education levels, like those who are illiterate or have basic schooling, show higher engagement, possibly indicating a greater need for support and information.

**Decision**: **Educational Outreach Programs** - By creating educational programs and resources, we can empower less-educated customers with the knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions, potentially increasing their engagement and satisfaction.

---

## Conclusion: Charting the Course Forward

By analyzing these insights, we are poised to make data-driven decisions that not only enhance customer engagement but also build stronger, more personalized relationships. From targeted student and retiree programs to optimized contact timing and tailored messaging, our path forward is clear: to understand, to serve, and to excel in meeting our customers’ needs.

As we implement these strategies, we look forward to not just accumulating more minutes of conversation, but making each minute count.

This storytelling approach integrates our data findings with strategic actions, setting the stage for impactful decision-making in our bank marketing efforts.


## Conclusion
The bank marketing project represents a holistic approach to leveraging data analytics for optimizing marketing initiatives and driving business growth. By harnessing the power of advanced analytical techniques and insightful visualizations, the project aims to empower stakeholders with actionable insights to make informed decisions and achieve strategic objectives.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Replaced 'unknown' values in `credit_default` and `mortgage` columns with NaN.
   - Calculated the percentage of NaN values for analysis.

3. **Date Columns:**
   - Converted `month` and `day` columns to appropriate data types.
   - Created a `last_contact_date` column to facilitate time-series analysis.

4. **Label Encoding:**
   - Transformed categorical variables, such as `previous_outcome`, into numeric values for correlation analysis.

5. **One-Hot Encoding:**
   - Converted categorical columns (`job`, `marital`, and `education`) into dummy variables to be included in the analysis.

## Correlation Analysis

### Steps Taken

1. **Target Variable Encoding:**
   - Mapped `campaign_outcome` to binary values: 1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no'.

2. **Correlation Matrix:**
   - Calculated the correlation between all features and the target variable (`campaign_outcome`).

## Key Insights

### Identified Key Features

- **Contact Duration:**
  - Highly correlated with campaign success (0.405). 
  - Suggests longer calls are more likely to result in successful outcomes.

- **Client ID:**
