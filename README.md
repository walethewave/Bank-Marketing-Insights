The dataset comprises the following attributes:

- **client_id**: Unique identifier for each client
- **age**: Age of the client
- **job**: Occupation of the client
- **marital**: Marital status of the client
- **education**: Level of education of the client
- **credit_default**: Whether the client has credit in default (True/False)
- **mortgage**: Whether the client has a housing loan (True/False)
- **month**: Last contact month of the year
- **day**: Last contact day of the month
- **contact_duration**: Duration of the last contact in seconds
- **number_contacts**: Number of contacts performed during this campaign for this client
- **previous_campaign_contacts**: Number of contacts performed before this campaign for this client
- **previous_outcome**: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign
- **cons_price_idx**: Consumer price index
- **euribor_three_months**: Euribor 3-month rate
- **campaign_outcome**: Outcome of the current marketing campaign (target variable)
- **year**: Last contact year
- **last_contact_date**: Date of the last contact
